# Card Game
Memory card matching game

## Rules of the game
- The goal is to collect the most pairs of cards.
- The game starts with Shuffle cards, face down, in rows.
- On each turn, a player turns over any two cards (one at a time), if the cards match, they will keep being open for the rest of the game.
- If they successfully match a pair they get to keep the cards, and that player gets another turn.
- When a player turns over two cards that do not match, those cards are turned face down again and it becomes the next playerâ€™s turn.
- The trick is to remember which cards are where.
- The person with the most pairs at the end of the game wins.

Godd luck! ðŸ˜¸
